make sure to have the following dependencies:
roscpp moveit_msgs moveit_visual_tools moveit_ros_planning_interface

note that "moveit" is not a dependency directly, only its subpackages



when trying to run motion_test_v1 (with moveit_visual_tools) i get error :
error loading the libmoveit_planning_scene_monitor.so.0.9.18

move group usage

you can create joint space goals and cartesian goals. cartesian goals can be reaching using joint space or linear motion.

Joint space goal:
    move_group.setJointValueTarget(current_joint_states);
    move_group.move();

Cartesian goal:
    move_group.setPoseTarget(store_pose); 
    move_group.move();


Linear trajectory:
    move_group.computeCartesianPath(waypoints, 0.005, 0.0, trajectory, true);
    plan.trajectory_=trajectory;
    move_group.execute(plan);




ADDING EEF
copied panda urdf gripper section
https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_resources/blob/master/panda_description/urdf/panda.urdf

i pasted this into the aubo_i5_with_gripper.urdf i created.
had to adjust offset and make sure urdf mesh file paths were correct

then followed setup assistant guide (had to delete old moveit config):
http://docs.ros.org/en/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html#step-6-label-end-effectors

with the nex config i had to rewrite aubo_i5_moveit_controller_manager.launch.xml and controllers.yaml. these are the only two customized files from moveit config.

also had to add static transform publishes to the launch file to create the frames for the gripper fingers. i think this means robot_state_publisher does not handle the gripper.
