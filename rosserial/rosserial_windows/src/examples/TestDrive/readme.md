rosserial windows TestDrive
===========================

This is an example of how to use rosserial_windows to send commands from a
windows app to a robot. All it does is send a cmd_vel Twist to the robot
with a static set of values. This can be updated to change the values based on 
joystick or keyboard inputs, or to send other messages.

For a full tutorial see http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_windows/Tutorials/Hello%20World

To use the example:

1. Create a new visual studio command line app project
2. Copy the ros_lib generated by rosserial_windows into your project
3. Copy the testdrive.cpp instead of your main cpp file
4. Add the .h and .cpp files from the *top level* of the ros_lib to your VS project (should only be WindowsSocket.h WindowsSocket.cpp duration.cpp time.cpp and ros.h)
5. Compile the project
6. Run the exe with the command line argument of the IP address of your robot
7. Watch your robot spin around!

Some tips:

* Do not enable unicode support. If your command line arguments are not working correctly, try turning off unicode as the character set.
* Turn off precompiled headers or WindowsSocket will not compile properly.
